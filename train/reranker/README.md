# Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n rag-retrieval python=3.8 && conda activate rag-retrieval
# To avoid compatibility issues between the automatically installed torch and your local CUDA, it is recommended to manually install a torch version compatible with your local CUDA before proceeding to the next step.
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


# Fine-tuning the Model

After installing the dependencies, we'll use specific examples to demonstrate how to fine-tune an open-source ranking model (BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3) using your own data. Alternatively, you can train a ranking model from scratch using BERT-based models (hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext) or LLM-based models (Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B). Additionally, we support distilling the ranking capabilities of LLM-based models into smaller BERT models.

## Data Loading

We offer two ways to load datasets to support different types of loss functions:

### Pointwise Data Loading

The format of pointwise data is a query, a doc, and its corresponding label. For examples, see [pointwise_reranker_train_data.jsonl](../../../example_data/pointwise_reranker_train_data.jsonl).
```
{"query": str, "content": str, "label": int|float}
```
- `content` is the actual content of the document corresponding to the query.
- `label` is the supervision signal for model fine-tuning and comes in two types:
  - Continuous: A continuous score between 0 and 1.
  - Discrete: Multi-level relevance labels (0/1/2/...). The data loading module will uniformly scale them to a continuous value in the range of 0 to 1.

> When the relevance is represented by multi-level labels, by setting `max_label` and `min_label`, the dataset will automatically scale the multi-level labels uniformly to the score range of 0 to 1.
> For example, if there are three-level labels (0, 1, 2) in the dataset, after scaling, we get: { label 0: 0, label 1: 0.5, label 2: 1 }.

Two loss functions are supported: binary cross entropy loss (BCE) (both binary classification and soft label cross entropy loss are supported) and mean square error loss (MSE).


### Grouped Data Loading


The format of grouped data is a query, a set of docs and corresponding labels. For examples, see [grouped_reranker_train_data_listwise_label.jsonl](../../../example_data/grouped_reranker_train_data_listwise_label.jsonl)

```
{"query": str, "hits": [{"content": str, "label": int|float}, ...]}
```
- `hits` contains all document samples corresponding to the query, and `content` is the actual content of the document.
- `label` is the supervision signal for model fine-tuning and can be of two types:
  - Continuous: A continuous score between 0 and 1.
  - Discrete: Multi-level relevance labels (0/1/2/...).

Two loss functions are supported under this configuration:

**RankNet Loss:**

Under this loss, rag-retrieval will automatically form a pair based on the labels corresponding to the query and doc to calculate the loss, and use the difference between the two for weighting.

```math
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{RankNet}= \sum_{i=1}^M\sum_{j=1}^M \mathbb{1}_{r_{i} < r_{j} } \ |r_j-r_i|\ \log(1 + \exp(s_i-s_j))
```

## Training

Training BERT-based Models with FSDP (DDP)
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1" nohup accelerate launch \
--config_file ../../../config/xlmroberta_default_config.yaml \
train_reranker.py \
--config config/training_bert.yaml \
> ./logs/training_bert.log &
```

Training LLM-based Models with DeepSpeed (Only applicable to zero 1-2; zero 3 is not currently compatible due to a bug when saving the model)
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1" nohup accelerate launch \
--config_file ../../../config/deepspeed/deepspeed_zero1.yaml \
train_reranker.py \
--config config/training_llm.yaml \
> ./logs/training_llm_deepspeed1.log &
```

## Parameter Explanation

### Multi-GPU Training Configuration Files
- For BERT-based models, FSDP is used by default to support multi-GPU training. Here are examples of configuration files:
  - [default_fsdp](https://github.com/NLPJCL/RAG-Retrieval/blob/master/config/default_fsdp.yaml): Use this configuration file if you want to train a ranking model from scratch based on hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext.
  - [xlmroberta_default_config](https://github.com/NLPJCL/RAG-Retrieval/blob/master/config/xlmroberta_default_config.yaml): Use this configuration file if you want to fine-tune models such as BAAI/bge-reranker-base, maidalun1020/bce-reranker-base_v1, or BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3, as they are all trained on the multilingual XLMRoberta.
- For LLM-based models, DeepSpeed is recommended to support multi-GPU training. Currently, only the training phases of zero1 and zero2 are supported. Here are examples of configuration files:
  - [deepspeed_zero1](https://github.com/NLPJCL/RAG-Retrieval/blob/master/config/deepspeed/deepspeed_zero1.yaml)
  - [deepspeed_zero2](https://github.com/NLPJCL/RAG-Retrieval/blob/master/config/deepspeed/deepspeed_zero2.yaml)
- Modifying Multi-GPU Training Configuration Files:
  - Change `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"` in the command to the GPUs you want to use.
  - Modify the `num_processes` parameter in the above-mentioned configuration files to the number of GPUs you want to use.

### Model-related Parameters
- `model_name_or_path`: The name of an open-source reranker model or the local server location where it is downloaded. For example: BAAI/bge-reranker-base, maidalun1020/bce-reranker-base_v1. You can also train from scratch, such as using BERT: hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext or LLM: Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B.
- `model_type`: Currently supports bert_encoder or llm_decoder models.
- `max_len`: The maximum input length supported by the data.

### Dataset-related Parameters
- `train_dataset`: The training dataset. See the above for the specific format.
- `val_dataset`: The validation dataset, with the same format as the training dataset (set to `None` if not available).
- `max_label`: The maximum label in the pointwise dataset, defaulting to 1.
- `min_label`: The minimum label in the pointwise dataset, defaulting to 0.

### Training-related Parameters
- `output_dir`: The directory where checkpoints and the final model are saved during training.
- `loss_type`: Choose one final-paper ranking objective: `ranknet` (RankNet), `ear` (EAR), `ear_sym` (EAR-Sym), or `pairwise_reg` (Pairwise Reg).
- `epoch`: The number of epochs to train the model on the training dataset.
- `lr`: The learning rate, typically between 1e-5 and 5e-5.
- `batch_size`: The number of query-doc pairs in each batch.
- `seed`: Set a unified seed for reproducibility of experimental results.
- `warmup_proportion`: The proportion of learning rate warm-up steps to the total number of model update steps. If set to 0, no learning rate warm-up will be performed, and the learning rate will directly decay cosine-wise from the set `lr`.
- `stable_proportion`: The proportion of steps during which the learning rate remains stable to the total number of model update steps, defaulting to 0.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: The number of gradient accumulation steps. The actual batch size of the model is equal to `batch_size` * `gradient_accumulation_steps` * `num_of_GPUs`.
- `mixed_precision`: Whether to perform mixed-precision training to reduce GPU memory requirements. Mixed-precision training optimizes GPU memory usage by using low precision for computation and high precision for parameter updates. Additionally, bf16 (Brain Floating Point 16) can effectively reduce abnormal loss scaling situations, but this type is only supported by some hardware.
- `save_on_epoch_end`: Whether to save the model after each epoch.
- `num_max_checkpoints`: Controls the maximum number of checkpoints saved during a single training session.
- `log_interval`: Record the loss every `x` parameter updates of the model.
- `log_with`: The visualization tool, choose from `wandb` and `tensorboard`.

### Model Parameter-related Parameters
- `num_labels`: The number of logits output by the model, which is the number of classification categories of the model, usually set to 1 by default.
- When using an LLM for discriminative ranking scoring, you need to manually construct the input format, which introduces the following parameters:
  - `query_format`, e.g., "query: {}"
  - `document_format`, e.g., "document: {}"
  - `seq`: Separates the query and document parts, e.g., " "
  - `special_token`: Indicates the end of the document content and guides the model to start scoring. Theoretically, it can be any token, e.g., "\</s>"
  - The overall format is: "query: xxx document: xxx\</s>"

# Loading the Model for Prediction

You can easily load a saved model for prediction.

### Cross-Encoder Model (BERT-like)
```python
ckpt_path = "./bge-reranker-m3-base"
reranker = CrossEncoder.from_pretrained(
    model_name_or_path=ckpt_path,
    num_labels=1,  # binary classification
)
reranker.model.to("cuda:0")
reranker.eval()

input_lst = [
    ["I like China", "I like China"],
    ["I like the United States", "I don't like the United States at all"]
]

res = reranker.compute_score(input_lst)

print(torch.sigmoid(res[0]))
print(torch.sigmoid(res[1]))
```

### LLM-Decoder Model (Based on MLP for Scalar Mapping)

> To meet the special requirements of using an LLM like "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B" for discriminative ranking, a specific format has been designed. The actual effect is: "query: {xxx} document: {xxx}\</s>". Experiments have shown that the introduction of \</s> significantly improves the ranking performance of the LLM [from https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04539 section 4.3].

```python
ckpt_path = "./Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct"
reranker = LLMDecoder.from_pretrained(
    model_name_or_path=ckpt_path,
    num_labels=1,  # binary classification
    query_format="query: {}",
    document_format="document: {}",
    seq="\n",
    special_token="\nrelevance",
)
reranker.model.to("cuda:0")
reranker.eval()

input_lst = [
    ["I like China", "I like China"],
    ["I like the United States", "I don't like the United States at all"],
]

res = reranker.compute_score(input_lst)

print(torch.sigmoid(res[0]))
print(torch.sigmoid(res[1]))
```
